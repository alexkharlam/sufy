## Future Plans

In the future updates, I plan to add the following features:

- Searching functionality: users will be able to search for notes and categories by their title or content.
- CSS refactoring: to improve the maintainability and readability of the styles.
- Render refactoring (optimization): to improve the performance of the app when managing a large number of notes and categories.
